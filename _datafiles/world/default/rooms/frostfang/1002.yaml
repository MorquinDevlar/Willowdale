title: Jail
description: The jail adjoins the Soldiers Barracks like a grim shadow, its cold stone
  walls damp with the weight of confinement. Dim torchlight flickers along the corridor,
  casting long, uneasy shadows across iron-barred windows and heavy oak doors reinforced
  with blackened steel. At the far end of the room, a thick iron door marked CELLS
  stands locked and unmoving, its rusted bolts and sturdy latch making it clearbno
  one passes through without command.
