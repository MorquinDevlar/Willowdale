title: Inside a Jail Cell
description: The cell is narrow and barren, carved from the same unforgiving stone
  as the rest of the jail. A single slit in the wall lets in a pale shaft of light,
  barely enough to see the rust-streaked walls and the straw-stuffed pallet shoved
  into the corner. The air is thick with mildew and the lingering stench of past occupants.
  Iron shackles hang limply from the wall, their presence more threatening than their
  current use. Every sound echoes with eerie claritybdrips of water, distant footsteps,
  or worse, silence.
